# Video Flashcards Converter

## TODO
- finish the averageOffset, it needs to get saved to selectedTimes if the user doesn't change anything
- apply averageOffset to video
- add text areas for source, furigana, translation, and notes
- add manual AI import options
- translate and make notes with AI API
- make sure each flashcard has a different "time" when downloading them
